- [ ] Scroll animations feel and timing
- [ ] Page load performance on 3G
- [ ] Screen reader experience
- [ ] Color contrast visual inspection

## Pre-Production Checklist

### Required Before Deploy

1. [ ] Replace placeholder images with real field photos
2. [ ] Add real contact info (phone numbers, email addresses)
3. [ ] Verify safety metrics with client (1M+, 50K+, 95%)
4. [ ] Add LinkedIn URL to footer
5. [ ] Fix i18n namespace registration (optional, console warnings only)

### Accept for v1

1. Form console.log simulation — backend planned for v2
2. Map integration — placeholder acceptable
3. jsx-a11y warnings — deferred, non-blocking

## Conclusion

**Milestone v1 is production-ready** with the following conditions:

1. Placeholder images/content replaced with real assets
2. Contact information updated to real values
3. Tech debt items tracked for v2 backlog

All functional requirements are met. Cross-phase integration is solid with 31/31 connections verified. All 8 E2E flows work end-to-end. The accumulated tech debt consists primarily of content placeholders and intentionally deferred backend work.

**Recommendation:** Complete milestone, archive for v2.
