# Phase 5: HSE Page (Crown Jewel) - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-21
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Showcase Jerash's safety commitment as the standout section of the website. Includes HSE commitment statement, all 10 commitment points from company profile, safety metrics/statistics, and HSE-related field images with bold visual design. This is the "crown jewel" — the page that differentiates Jerash from competitors.

## Implementation Decisions

### Visual Hierarchy
- Full-screen hero with HSE commitment statement over dramatic field image
- Content flow: Hero → Commitment Points → Field Images (interspersed) → Metrics at bottom
- Field images interspersed throughout to break up text sections
- Professional bold visual tone — impactful but measured, not overwhelming

### Commitment Points Layout
- Numbered vertical list format (not cards or accordion)
- Subtle numbered bullets — focus on text content, not large accent numbers
- Single HSE icon for the whole section, not per-point icons
- Staggered reveal animation — points appear one after another on scroll

### Safety Metrics Display
- Both incident-focused AND training-focused metrics combined
- Animated counters (numbers count up when scrolled into view, like homepage stats)
- Positioned at page bottom as final impression
- Match page background styling — same as rest of page, larger typography

### Field Images Integration
- Mix of PPE/safety equipment AND team-in-action imagery
- Contained images with parallax scroll effect (not full-width edge-to-edge)
- 3-4 image breaks throughout the page between content sections
- No overlay treatment — pure images without color tint

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact parallax scroll intensity
- Specific image placement between sections
- Typography scale and spacing
- Animation timing and easing

## Specific Ideas

- Hero should make immediate visual impact — this is the crown jewel page
- The 10 commitment points are from the company profile document (already have content)
- Metrics should prove the safety culture that commitment points establish
- Parallax effect should feel subtle and professional, not gimmicky
