# Phase 3: Homepage Sections - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-21
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Homepage presents Jerash's identity with cinematic impact and complete company overview. Includes hero slideshow, vision/mission/values sections, statistics counters, partners preview (SLB), joint ventures preview (Kweti), and services overview. All content displays in Arabic and English.

## Implementation Decisions

### Hero Slideshow
- Ken Burns zoom effect (slow zoom/pan on each image with fade between)
- 6-8 seconds per image before transition
- Text overlay positioned left-bottom (LTR) / right-bottom (RTL) — image-focused, text as caption
- Navigation: arrows for manual control + dots showing current slide

### Section Layout & Rhythm
- Full-bleed continuous background — sections separated by spacing only, no alternating colors
- Moderate vertical spacing (60-80px) between major sections
- Vision, Mission, Values as three separate dedicated sections (each with own reveal animation)
- Long-scroll storytelling format — all content on one page, user scrolls through full story

### Statistics Presentation
- Count up from zero animation (numbers rapidly count to final value)
- Large bold numbers with smaller label text underneath
- Single horizontal row (3-4 stats across) on desktop
- Same background as page flow — no contrasting band, blends with continuous design

### Content Density
- Vision/Mission/Values: headline + 1-2 sentences each (brief and impactful)
- Images alongside text in content sections (field photos paired with content)
- Text dominant (60/40) split — larger text area, image as accent
- Mobile stacking: alternate per section (creates rhythm on scroll)
- Services preview: icon grid showing 6-8 services with names and "See all" link
- Partners and Joint Ventures: two separate sections
- Partners/JV detail level: logo + company name only (minimal, link to detail pages)
- Management Philosophy: image + text split format (leadership/team image with philosophy text)

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact Ken Burns zoom percentages and timing curves
- Which field images to use in which sections
- Typography scale and font weights
- Specific reveal animation variants per section
- Stats section exact metrics (years experience, project count, employee count from company data)

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Hero should feel cinematic — Ken Burns gives that documentary quality
- Continuous page flow creates storytelling journey (not choppy card sections)
- Stats should feel substantial but not overwhelming
- Services preview gives a taste without duplicating the full services page
